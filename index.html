            <h2>Beverage stand</h2>
        </li>
        <p>People like to do lemonade stands during the summer time,but there are other beverages that could be sold around other parts of the year.During the winter,you could sell hot chocolate.
         Most people drink wine and cocktails during the spring.The key is to know what you would drink during a certain season,or what you usually drink during the different seasons.Also choose a good place to set up your stand.However,if you are selling on public property,make sure to get a permit.</p>

              <br>
          <li><h2>Yard sales</h2></li><p>Instead of doing one yard sale in your yard,you could do multiple yard sales during the summer break,or whenever you have time.I suggest the summer break because most people actually go around buying stuff during the summer. Always make sure to have an eye catching sign and hang up your signs in places where there is always lots of people.

              <br>
          <li><h2>Yardcare service</h2></li><p>This is an idea that would be better to do with multiple people,like your friends or family.As long as you are 
            not too overwhelmed with work,than you should be okay.This could be anything from raking lawns to mowing lawns,to watering plants,and othet things 
            like those.</p><img src="https://mydecorative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/professional-lawn-care-service.jpg"alt="Yardcare service">

              <br>
          <li><h2>Car washing</h2></li><p>This is something that you could do by yourself,although it would be easier to do it with others.For this,all you 
            need to do is make sign and tell people your adress,so that they can come by whenever you are ready.Make sure to write out a schedule that says 
            the times when you are aviable so that people don't just show up at your house when you are not there.Anotehr few things to do is making sure you 
            have enough soap,sponges,and water.depending on the size and value of the car,you should charge them.Also charge them on account of how much time 
            it takes you.If you want to do some quick jobs,write on your schedule when the time for quick washing is,and make sure to set aside  a designated 
            time for quick washing.You should do this with otehrs so that you can get it done faster.

            <h2>Dog walking</h2>
        </li>
        <p>This title pretty much speaks for itself.You just offer to walk people's dogs for money.Depending on how far they want you to walk the dog
             you should charge them.And if you have to pick up any dog poop,then you should charge extra.Maybe charge on how wild the dog is too,or if
              its too much to handle,have a friend or family member help you.</p>

            n online shop,or go out in public and sell.</p>

        <li><h2>Busking</h2></li>Have you ever seen people on the side of the street or at the board walk playing music,with their instrument 
        case open.Thats busking.The case is open so that people passing by can put money in it if they want to.If you have any musical talent,
        like being able to rap,sing,or play a certain instrument really well,you should go busking.</p>

            </li>
            <p>No frills,Superstore,Walmart,and Sobeys.These are grocery store chains in Halifax.They are all large businesses that started small,and grew bigger over time.
                For this you can start by selling your own products and when you can,incresase the amount of products that you can sell,and make the place where you sell bigger,
                while hiring more employees.</p><img src="https://logodix.com/logo/308236.png"alt="Sobeys logo">

            <li><h2>Realtor</h2></li><p>When people want to sell their houses,most people try to sell it themselves.However,realtors are becoming a much more modern way to sell your house.These are people who are trained to help you sell your house.They tell you what to fix,what to highlight,how the desrciption for the house should be written,along with other important details.If you want to be a realtor,or start your own real estate company,you might be traveling a lot.Real Estate companies make $95,430 per year. This is a table of the pay of realtors in each province of Canada.</p>

            <li><h2>Restaurant or food truck</h2></li><p>If you are an excellent cook,this job is for you.If you can cook something unique,you can own a restaurant or food truck.If you can cook something that has already been created,but better than others,then that should be something on your menu.A restuarant can be spread around all over the world,although it costs much more money than a food truck,because you need to pay for heating lights,electricity,and other things like that for every one of your buildings.However,with a food truck,you can drive wherever you want and sell your products.You also have to pay to cross borders,and pay for gas.You might also have to find one of those ferrys that takes cars and the driver to it's destination.But it is still less expensive than a restuarant or chain of restaurants.</p>

            <p>Influencers such as Mr Beast(Jimmy Donaldson),and Dream(Clay (Smith?)),are some of the richest people of this generation,and all 
                they do is play video games.Lots of others like them make more money than any regular employee does and the way they do it is simple.
                They create videos of them playing video games,pranking their friends,and other things that we would normally think of as stupid.But a 
                lot of us like the way that they do it,and we might follow their social media accounts,and subsrcibe to their channels.They make money 
                based on the amount of views their video gets,the amount of ad blockers,subsrcibers,clicks an ad gets,ad blockers,ad views,video lenght,
                and ad quality. Sometime,to save money,they ask companies to sponser their video.If they mention the company that sponsored them,then they will get sponsored.If 
                this influencer is popular,they will also create merchandise to sell,and every one thousand views,they get $5,000.This is a list of the

              <p>When advertising your business and products,you need to be creative and find ways to capture people's attention. Think about it like this:would you pay attention to a sign on the road that said yard sale? Would you pay attention to an add on tv telling you about a two for one deal at a restaurant? Would you pay attention to a billboard on the side of the highway saying that their will be a lemonde stand opening at a certain adress?
